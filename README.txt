This is a repository of code samples and other presentation materials
written by members of the EMC Edmonton Functional Programming User
Group.

Disclaimer: EMC does not endorse or sponsor our group. We just all
happen to be EMC employees in Edmonton, and giving the group a less
specific title like "Edmonton Functional Programming User Group" seems
presumptuous.
