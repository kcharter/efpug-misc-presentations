I've assembled for talks at the Edmonton Functional Programming Users
Group, or EFPUG for short.

Disclaimer: We started off as the EMC Edmonton Functional Programming
User Group, but now we've got the more general name. Despite having
'EMC' in our original name, EMC has never endorsed nor sponsored our
group. Our original members all happened to be EMC employees in
Edmonton, and giving the group a less specific title like "Edmonton
Functional Programming User Group" seemed presumptuous at the time.
